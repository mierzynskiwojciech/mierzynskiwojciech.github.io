### How does a bike-share navigate speedy success? (Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Case Study)

This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. The goal was to help Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, figure out how to turn more of their casual riders into annual members.

#### What I Did

I worked with trip data from April 2020 to April 2021. Using SQL, I cleaned and prepared the data (removing duplicates, fixing missing values, calculating ride times, etc.). After that, I analyzed usage patterns and built visualizations in Tableau to compare casual riders with annual members.

#### What I Found

- Members usually rode on weekdays, often for shorter trips, which looked like commuting. Casual riders, on the other hand, tended to ride on weekends and took longer trips — more for leisure.

- Both groups rode more in summer and less in winter, but the difference was especially clear with casual riders.

- Downtown stations had the highest activity for both groups, making them a good place to focus marketing.

#### Why It Matters

From a business point of view, these findings suggest a few actions:

- Promote memberships during the summer months, when casual ridership is highest.

- Design targeted promotional campaigns focusing on converting casual riders into annual members, emphasizing the benefits for daily activities.

- Focus marketing efforts around downtown areas, where visibility is highest.

#### My Takeaway

This project gave me practice in the full analytics cycle: cleaning and transforming raw data, running SQL queries, building dashboards, and — most importantly — turning data into recommendations a business can act on. It showed me how analysis isn’t just about numbers, but about telling a story that helps decision-makers see the next step.

### COVID-19 Dashboard analysis

This project was something I worked on independently because I was curious about the global impact of COVID-19 on health and society, and I wanted to practice pulling insights from a large, messy dataset. I used data from Our World in Data covering cases, deaths, and vaccinations over a two-year period.

#### What I Did

I imported the dataset into SQL, where I focused on cleaning and transforming the data — removing duplicates, fixing missing values, and making sure the time-series data was consistent. Then I built a dashboard in Tableau that tracked:

- Global numbers as for 13th of April 2023

- Percentage of population vaccinated per country

- Percent Population Infected in selected countries

- Percent of people infected per country in year 2023

#### What I Found

By this point in the pandemic, COVID-19 had infected hundreds of millions worldwide. The global totals underline how far-reaching the crisis was, even as vaccination campaigns were well underway.

Some countries saw much higher infection percentages than others, reflecting differences in government policies, healthcare systems, and pandemic response strategies.

Vaccination uptake also showed strong variation. Many high-income countries achieved very high coverage, whereas other regions lagged behind.

#### Why It Matters

Even though this was an educational project, it highlighted the power of dashboards in helping decision-makers quickly spot trends and react. For example:

-Governments could see which regions needed urgent vaccine distribution.

-Health organizations could track how restrictions or policies impacted case numbers.

-The general public could better understand the situation with clear visuals instead of raw numbers.

#### My Takeaway

This project taught me the importance of storytelling with data. A dataset on its own can be overwhelming, but by cleaning it, visualizing it, and connecting the dots, I learned how to create something that both informs and guides action. It also gave me more confidence in using SQL and Tableau together in real-world scenarios.
