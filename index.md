### How does a bike-share navigate speedy success? (Google Data Analytics Certification Capstone Case Study)

This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate. The goal was to help Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, figure out how to turn more of their casual riders into annual members.

# What I Did

I worked with trip data from April 2020 to April 2021. Using SQL, I cleaned and prepared the data (removing duplicates, fixing missing values, calculating ride times, etc.). After that, I analyzed usage patterns and built visualizations in Tableau to compare casual riders with annual members.

# What I Found

- Members usually rode on weekdays, often for shorter trips, which looked like commuting. Casual riders, on the other hand, tended to ride on weekends and took longer trips — more for leisure.

- Both groups rode more in summer and less in winter, but the difference was especially clear with casual riders.

- Downtown stations had the highest activity for both groups, making them a good place to focus marketing.

# Why It Matters

From a business point of view, these findings suggest a few actions:

- Promote memberships during the summer months, when casual ridership is highest.

- Tailor marketing: highlight the convenience of annual memberships for weekday commuters, and the cost savings for weekend riders who use bikes a lot in summer.

- Focus marketing efforts around downtown areas, where visibility is highest.

# My Takeaway

This project gave me practice in the full analytics cycle: cleaning and transforming raw data, running SQL queries, building dashboards, and — most importantly — turning data into recommendations a business can act on. It showed me how analysis isn’t just about numbers, but about telling a story that helps decision-makers see the next step.

It has been a span of two years since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have examined the dataset encompassing this crucial period and have utilized visualization techniques to present comprehensive insights regarding the prevailing circumstances as of April 2023.

The COVID-19 data, sourced from January 2020 through April 2023, has been conveniently accessible through the esteemed online repository located at https://ourworldindata.org. Employing the proficient combination of SQL and Tableau, I conducted an analysis to unravel valuable observations.
